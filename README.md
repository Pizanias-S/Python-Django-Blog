# Python-Django-Blog
My Blog

A simple Django blog page with posts, an admin page, comments, read later function and tags.

[Link to my Blog](http://djangomysitepiz-env.eba-y4mkvbmp.eu-south-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/)

Deployed using Elasticbeanstalk (free version) and RDS (free version) with postgresql.

Unfortunately, I had to take down the blog from AWS because it started charging me.
For a project using AWS please see the Dinopedia repository.
